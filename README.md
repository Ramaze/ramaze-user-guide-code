# Ramaze Tutorials

This repository contains the source code used for all tutorials in the user guide which is
located at http://ramaze.net/documentation/index.html

## Requirements

The only requirement is Ruby and of course Ramaze. While most of the code should work on 
1.8 it's recommended that you use 1.9.2 instead.
